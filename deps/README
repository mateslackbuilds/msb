This directory contains third-party (i.e. not in MATE upstream) dependencies
of packages in /base and /extra.  Some of these have been pulled from
SlackBuilds.org with minor modifications.  If you have already installed any
of these packages from SlackBuilds.org, then you shouldn't need to install
them again.  If that's the case, you might want to manually edit the
mate-build-deps.sh script and remove the lines for
the applicable dependencies so they aren't built a second time.
