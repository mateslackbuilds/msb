# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.  Line
# up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and the '|'
# on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.  You must
# make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':'.

pam:
pam: PAM = Pluggable Authentication Modules.  Basically, it is a flexible
pam: mechanism for authenticating users.  PAM provides a way to develop
pam: programs that are independent of authentication scheme.  However,
pam: these programs will need "authentication modules" (and libpam) at
pam: run-time in order to work.
