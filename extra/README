This directory contains extra packages for the MATE desktop environment.  None
of them are required for basic functionality, but instead are extra additions
or additional software or plugins.  Some of them may have additional
dependencies that will be noted in a README and that may be added here as time
permits.  Working packages will be added to the 'mate-build-extra.sh' script.
More packages may be added here over time.
